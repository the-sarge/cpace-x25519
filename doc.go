// Package cpace implements an auditable draft-irtf-cfrg-cpace-21
// CPACE-RISTR255-SHA512 initiator-responder flow.
//
// This module is an Internet-Draft implementation. It is not independently
// audited and must not be treated as production-ready cryptographic software.
//
// The public API intentionally exposes only an initiator-responder flow with
// mandatory explicit key confirmation. A session is returned only after both
// sides have confirmed possession of the same intermediate session key.
// Respond success alone is not authentication.
//
// Scalar randomness always comes from crypto/rand.Reader; the package does not
// accept caller-supplied randomness through the public API.
// Config and wire fields have package-owned per-field size caps; associated
// data is capped at 64 KiB and smaller identity/context fields are capped more
// tightly.
//
// Config.SessionID must be non-empty by default. Config.AllowEmptySessionID is
// only for draft-21 compatibility tests or deliberately compatible profiles
// that accept weaker replay and transcript separation.
//
// Session.Close performs best-effort cleanup of session key material and makes
// future Export calls fail. PeerAssociatedData and PeerID expose copied,
// non-secret metadata bound into the confirmed exchange.
//
// Both parties must use the same role orientation: InitiatorID identifies the
// Start side, and ResponderID identifies the Respond side. Applications that
// negotiate PAKE versions, suites, or protocol modes outside this package must
// provide their own downgrade protection for that outer negotiation.
