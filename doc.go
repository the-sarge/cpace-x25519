// Package cpace implements an auditable draft-irtf-cfrg-cpace-21
// CPACE-RISTR255-SHA512 initiator-responder flow.
//
// This module is an Internet-Draft implementation. It is not independently
// audited and must not be treated as production-ready cryptographic software.
//
// The public API intentionally exposes only an initiator-responder flow with
// mandatory explicit key confirmation. A session is returned only after both
// sides have confirmed possession of the same intermediate session key.
// Respond success alone is not authentication.
//
// Scalar randomness always comes from crypto/rand.Reader; the package does not
// accept caller-supplied randomness through the public API.
// Input and wire fields have package-owned per-field size caps; associated
// data is capped at 64 KiB and smaller identity/context fields are capped more
// tightly.
//
// Input.SessionID must be non-empty by default. Input.AllowEmptySessionID is
// only for draft-21 compatibility tests or deliberately compatible profiles
// that accept weaker replay and transcript separation.
//
// Initiator and Responder are single-use state. Finish consumes them on
// success and failure; Close releases their local persistent secret material
// when an exchange is abandoned before Finish. Close is nil-safe and
// idempotent, and value copies share terminal state.
//
// Session.Close performs best-effort cleanup of session key material and makes
// future Export calls fail. PeerAssociatedData and PeerID expose copied,
// non-secret metadata bound into the confirmed exchange.
//
// Callers provide role-local Input: Start maps SelfID to the initiator identity
// and PeerID to the responder identity, while Respond maps SelfID to the
// responder identity and PeerID to the initiator identity. Applications that
// negotiate PAKE versions, suites, or protocol modes outside this package must
// provide their own downgrade protection for that outer negotiation.
