# CPace-X25519 for Go

[![OpenSSF Scorecard](https://api.scorecard.dev/projects/github.com/the-sarge/cpace-x25519/badge)](https://scorecard.dev/viewer/?uri=github.com/the-sarge/cpace-x25519)

This repository implements `draft-irtf-cfrg-cpace-21` for the
`CPACE-X25519-SHA512` suite only.

Status: auditable draft implementation. This code has not had independent
cryptographic review and is not production-ready.

Current work is release readiness, not new policy design. The public API and package-profile choices are frozen for review unless a new finding reopens a decision. ADR-0008 records a narrow public-lifecycle thaw for `Initiator.Close` and `Responder.Close`; ADR-0009 records a broad Caller input replacement whose authorization is narrowly limited to its follow-up `Input` implementation. All unrelated public-surface and package-profile choices remain frozen. Before any production-readiness claim, the release bar in `docs/security-assessment.md` must be satisfied.

The public API exposes only an initiator-responder flow with mandatory explicit
key confirmation:

1. `Start` returns initiator state and message A.
2. `Respond` consumes message A and returns responder state and message B.
3. `Initiator.Finish` verifies message B and returns message C plus `Session`.
4. `Responder.Finish` verifies message C and returns `Session`.

`Respond` returning success is not authentication. Only successful
`Initiator.Finish` and `Responder.Finish` calls return authenticated sessions.
Treat message B as an unauthenticated protocol message until the finish calls
complete.

This module is a package-specific `cpace-go` profile over draft-21. It builds CI internally from the draft version, suite, protocol roles, caller-provided party identities, and caller context. It also owns its binary wire framing; applications should treat message bytes as opaque and versioned by this module. The current wire format prefix byte is `0xc1`.

Callers provide role-local `Input`. The initiator calls `Start` with `SelfID` set to the initiator identity and `PeerID` set to the responder identity; the responder calls `Respond` with `SelfID` set to the responder identity and `PeerID` set to the initiator identity. `Password`, `Context`, and `SessionID` are shared session values that both sides supply identically; `LocalAssociatedData` is each side's local associated data and may differ. Do not use only globally hardcoded role labels such as `"client"` and `"server"` for all users or deployments. Bind stable, application-meaningful party identities into `SelfID` and `PeerID`.

Provide a fresh, non-secret `SessionID` agreed by both parties for every
session. Empty session IDs are rejected by default because they weaken replay
and transcript separation properties; that failure wraps both `ErrInvalidInput`
and `ErrEmptySessionID`. `AllowEmptySessionID` exists only for draft-21
compatibility tests or deliberately compatible profiles that accept the weaker
empty-sid behavior. If an outer protocol negotiates PAKE versions, ciphersuites,
or whether CPace is used at all, that negotiation needs its own downgrade
protection; this package does not authenticate negotiation it never sees. See
`docs/integration-guidance.md` for outer negotiation and downgrade-protection
guidance.

`Initiator.Finish` and `Responder.Finish` are single-use calls. Passing a malformed message or a message that fails confirmation consumes the state and requires restarting the exchange. If an exchange might be abandoned after successful `Start` or `Respond`, call `Initiator.Close` or `Responder.Close` to release local single-use state secrets; it is safe to `defer` that close immediately after construction. `Close` after `Finish` is a no-op, and constructed value copies share the same terminal state.

`Session.TranscriptID` is the draft `CPaceSidOutput` for the confirmed CPace
transcript, not a complete channel binding for outer protocol negotiation.
`Session.Export` derives deterministic, domain-separated application key material from the confirmed ISK. It is not a source of fresh randomness; use specific labels and contexts for each exported key purpose. `Session.Close` performs best-effort cleanup of the session key material and makes future `Export` calls fail with `ErrSessionClosed`; non-secret metadata accessors remain available after close. `Session.PeerAssociatedData` returns the exact peer local associated data bound into the confirmed exchange. `Session.PeerID` returns the caller-configured peer identity that was bound into CI and confirmed by the exchange; it is not parsed from peer-controlled wire data.

Scalar randomness is always drawn from Go's `crypto/rand.Reader`. Callers do
not provide randomness to `Start` or `Respond`.

Input and wire fields have package-owned per-field caps: passwords and party IDs are limited to 4 KiB, context and session IDs to 1 KiB, and local associated data to 64 KiB. Valid package-owned message shapes are governed by those per-field caps and exact public-share/tag lengths; malformed framed inputs also hit a 128 KiB aggregate decoder backstop before field parsing proceeds. Local associated data should bind protocol context, not carry large payloads; represent large external artifacts with a digest, Merkle root, exporter, or other fixed-size commitment.

## Validation

This repository uses `Taskfile.yml` as the local validation facade:

```sh
task quick
task check
task check:changed
task lint:golangci
task docs:check
task bench
FUZZTIME=30s PARALLEL=2 task fuzz
FUZZ_RACE=0 GOMAXPROCS=4 FUZZ_TEST_PARALLEL=2 FUZZTIME=8m PARALLEL=2 task fuzz
```

`task check` requires the normal Go/tooling prerequisites plus `jq`, because the full gate runs release-helper smoke tests that validate CycloneDX SBOM JSON. `task lint:golangci` runs a curated advisory analyzer set and is not part of the required local gate.

The fuzz-target registry lives in `.github/fuzz-targets.json` and records each target function, package, and OSS-Fuzz binary name; `go test ./...` includes a drift check that keeps it in sync with defined fuzz functions and `ossfuzz/build.sh`. GitHub-hosted pull-request CI is intentionally light because it runs untrusted fork code: code changes set up Go, run `go test ./...`, and run the evidence baseline validator; Markdown-only PRs normally run docs validation without Go, except changes to `docs/evidence-baseline.md`, `docs/evidence-baseline-summary-docs.txt`, `docs/evidence/**`, or summary docs listed in `docs/evidence-baseline-summary-docs.txt` also run the evidence baseline validator. Scheduled hosted lanes run `govulncheck`, advisory `gosec`, curated `golangci-lint`, and a 5-minute-per-target fuzz regression pass as background signal. Run the full local gate, longer maintainer-machine fuzzing, vulnerability scan, advisory `gosec` scan, and curated `golangci-lint` scan locally before release-oriented changes. The default fuzz lane keeps the race detector on for smoke runs; use `FUZZ_RACE=0` for longer campaigns after `task check` has already covered race-instrumented tests. See `docs/ci-policy.md` for the hosted and self-hosted runner threat model.

Release-readiness work should record exact evidence: commit SHA, command or
workflow, duration for fuzzing, target count, and residual risks. Dependency
review evidence lives in `docs/dependency-review.md`; fuzz campaign evidence
lives in `docs/fuzz-evidence.md`; security/spec audit evidence lives in
`docs/security-spec-audit.md`; Capslock capability-analysis evidence lives in
`docs/capslock-report.md`; local benchmark guidance lives in
`docs/performance.md`. External reviewer scope and review questions are
summarized in `docs/external-review-handoff.md`; security boundaries are
summarized in `docs/threat-model.md`. Downstream release verification
instructions live in `docs/release-verification.md`. Project governance,
security-gate, and VEX policies live in `docs/governance.md`,
`docs/security-gates.md`, and `docs/vex.md`.

Current pinned evidence baselines and freshness caveats are indexed in `docs/evidence-baseline.md`.

```go
initiator, msgA, err := cpace.Start(initCfg)
defer initiator.Close()
responder, msgB, err := cpace.Respond(respCfg, msgA)
defer responder.Close()
msgC, initSession, err := initiator.Finish(msgB)
defer initSession.Close()
respSession, err := responder.Finish(msgC)
defer respSession.Close()
key, err := initSession.Export([]byte("application key"), nil, 32)
```

Release policy: keep tags in the `v0.x` range until independent review is
complete and the release bar in `docs/security-assessment.md` is satisfied.
