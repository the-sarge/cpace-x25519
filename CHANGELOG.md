# Changelog

## Unreleased

- Add external review handoff notes, public contribution guidance, issue
  templates, a pull-request template, and reviewer outreach notes.
- Add threat-model and release-checklist docs for external review and future
  exact-candidate evidence refresh.
- Add the OpenSSF Best Practices Baseline badge to the README.
- Add Developer Certificate of Origin signoff policy and PR validation.
- Add coordinated vulnerability disclosure response timeframes to
  `SECURITY.md`.
- Add a project secrets and credentials policy covering storage, access, and
  rotation.
- Add release verification instructions for signed Git tags and future release
  assets.
- Document the expected release signer identity for release verification.
- Document support scope and duration for `v0.x` prereleases.
- Add governance, CI, test-update, SCA/SAST threshold, VEX, SBOM, multi-repo,
  and attack-surface policy docs for OpenSSF review.
- Clarify SSH allowed-signers setup for release tag verification.
- Add branch-protection-ready dependency and SAST gate workflows for OpenSSF
  review, covering GitHub Dependency Review, module verification,
  `govulncheck`, blocking `gosec -tests`, and same-repository gosec SARIF
  upload.
- Add benchmark coverage and a `task bench` facade for hot protocol, exporter,
  and parser paths with `-benchmem`.
- Add godoc examples for exporter domain separation, transcript IDs,
  confirmation-failure handling, and session close behavior.
- Add Capslock capability-analysis evidence for the external-review packet.
- Stage OSS-Fuzz project files for the existing native Go fuzz targets and
  validate them with the local OSS-Fuzz helper flow.

## v0.1.1 - 2026-05-06

- Publish a CI/security-process hardening prerelease with no Go API, protocol,
  or dependency changes from `v0.1.0`.
- Add tag-triggered release validation covering tests, race tests,
  `govulncheck`, and `gosec`.
- Add CodeQL, OpenSSF Scorecard, Staticcheck Advisory, Actionlint, and
  cross-platform smoke workflows.
- Upload gosec SARIF to GitHub Code Scanning and keep Code Scanning open
  alerts at zero after false-positive/noise triage.
- Tighten workflow permissions, keep third-party actions SHA-pinned, and keep
  release tags as signed annotated tags.
- Clarify public fuzz evidence and ignore private local scratch/planning files.

## v0.1.0 - 2026-05-06

- Clarify that `Respond` success is not authentication; only successful
  `Initiator.Finish` and `Responder.Finish` calls return authenticated
  sessions.
- Document role-ID orientation, `SessionID` freshness, outer downgrade
  responsibility, `TranscriptID` scope, and `Export` domain separation.
- Add draft-21 Ristretto255 generator-vector coverage, assert
  `sid_output_oc`, and add reflected-share regression coverage.
- Expand fuzz coverage with protocol-entry, scalar verification, and message
  round-trip fuzz targets.
- Add security tooling updates: `govulncheck -test`, weekly vulnerability
  scanning, Dependabot, and advisory `gosec` SARIF artifacts.
- Add best-effort cleanup for owned protocol temporaries, consumed scalar
  state, derived generator elements, and consumed responder state.
- Prevalidate responder-side message A public shares before responder scalar
  sampling while retaining the final `scalarMultVFY` protocol check.
- Add `docs/interview-results-triage.md` and start `DEV-JOURNAL.md` to record
  review triage and landing notes.
- Define the package-owned wire framing as format v1 with prefix byte `0xc1`.
  No released versions used the earlier draft-revision byte.
- Add `ErrRandomness` for random-source read failures and unusable scalar
  samples.
- Document and test that `Finish` consumes protocol state even when parsing or
  confirmation fails.
- Lighten GitHub-hosted CI before release, add docs-only PR validation, and add
  local `quick`, `check:changed`, docs, formatting, and ast-grep validation
  lanes.
- Remove public `Config.Rand`; `Start` and `Respond` now always draw scalar
  randomness from `crypto/rand.Reader`, with deterministic readers confined to
  package-internal tests and fuzzing.
- Reject empty `SessionID` by default, add `ErrEmptySessionID`, and add
  `AllowEmptySessionID` as an explicit draft-21 compatibility opt-in.
- Add `Session.Close`, `ErrSessionClosed`, `PeerAssociatedData`, and `PeerID`;
  closing a session clears session-owned key material best-effort and prevents
  future `Export` calls.
- Keep confirmation tags draft-compatible and replace the former 1 MiB generic
  field cap with non-configurable per-field caps: 4 KiB for passwords and IDs,
  1 KiB for context and session IDs, 64 KiB for associated data, and exact
  public-share/tag lengths on the wire.
- Keep draft-21 Ristretto255 scalar sampling via masked canonical 32-byte
  values and document why the `SetUniformBytes` alternative is not used.
- Close the policy/API decision phase in the project docs and shift release
  tracking to dependency review, long fuzzing, security/spec audit, and
  external review readiness.
- Refresh dependency review with `govulncheck -test -show verbose ./...` and
  advisory `gosec v2.26.1`; clean up the LEB128 parser to avoid integer
  conversions flagged by gosec.
- Make `task fuzz` disable the outer Go test timeout and allow explicit
  `FUZZ_RACE=0` long campaigns after race-instrumented tests pass.
- Record fuzz evidence for all 14 registered fuzz targets, including a local
  smoke run and long ARM/Intel runs.
- Audit the security assessment and spec matrix against the merged
  release-readiness implementation and record the result in
  `docs/security-spec-audit.md`.
- Add application integration guidance for outer PAKE/version negotiation,
  downgrade protection, identity orientation, and CPace session outputs.
- License the project under BSD-3-Clause.
- Publish the first `v0.x` draft-21 snapshot. This release is not
  production-ready.
