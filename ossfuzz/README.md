# OSS-Fuzz Staging

This directory stages the files intended for a future
`google/oss-fuzz/projects/cpace` upstream pull request. The active fuzz targets
remain in this repository in `fuzz_test.go` and are registered locally in
`.github/fuzz-targets.json`.

Before opening the upstream OSS-Fuzz PR:

1. Copy these files into a fork of `google/oss-fuzz` under `projects/cpace`.
2. Confirm `primary_contact` in `project.yaml` is the maintainer
   Google-account-associated email that should receive ClusterFuzz access and
   private bug notifications.
3. Build and check locally from the OSS-Fuzz checkout:

```sh
python3 infra/helper.py build_image cpace
python3 infra/helper.py build_fuzzers --sanitizer address cpace /path/to/cpace
python3 infra/helper.py check_build cpace
```

On Apple Silicon hosts, use the production `x86_64` path explicitly:

```sh
DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 python3 infra/helper.py build_fuzzers --architecture x86_64 --sanitizer address cpace /path/to/cpace
DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 python3 infra/helper.py check_build cpace
```

OSS-Fuzz native Go fuzzing builds `testing.F` fuzzers as libFuzzer binaries.
The Go integration currently supports `libfuzzer` with the `address` sanitizer.
For native Go fuzzers, `F.Add` seeds are not imported automatically by
OSS-Fuzz; add explicit seed corpora later if the first coverage reports show a
need for them.

Local validation on 2026-05-07 used a temporary `google/oss-fuzz` checkout,
mounted this repository as the source path, and passed:

```sh
DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 python3 infra/helper.py build_fuzzers --architecture x86_64 --sanitizer address cpace /Users/josh/code/github.com/the-sarge/cpace
DOCKER_DEFAULT_PLATFORM=linux/amd64 python3 infra/helper.py check_build cpace
```
