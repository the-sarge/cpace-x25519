# Security Assessment

Status: maintained self-assessment for an auditable draft implementation. The original assessment was reviewed against commit `2e09774f171dde8c62763d6e35a258b0fef88801` on 2026-05-08. This fork's X25519 port changes protocol code, dependency shape, vectors, and invalid-share behavior after the inherited `f7efa6a963a954952b1ecad3f46530f13799fe89` evidence baseline; do not use inherited dependency, fuzz, Capslock, or security/spec audit evidence for cpace-x25519 release claims until those lanes are refreshed against an exact cpace-x25519 candidate.

## Cryptographic Scope

Only `CPACE-X25519-SHA512` from `draft-irtf-cfrg-cpace-21` is implemented.
The public API exposes initiator-responder mode only and requires explicit key
confirmation before returning a `Session`.

## Secret-Dependent Behavior

The implementation uses Go standard-library SHA-512, HMAC, HKDF, and randomness primitives plus a local X25519 Montgomery ladder and Elligator2 generator mapping over `filippo.io/edwards25519/field` arithmetic. The ladder clamps each 32-byte scalar per X25519 before multiplication. The local ladder and generator mapping require independent cryptographic review before any production-ready claim.

Password handling follows the draft generator string padding rule. For short
passwords the first SHA-512 input block length is independent of password
length, but Go slice allocation and caller-side password handling are not
constant time.

The draft recommends, but does not require, a unique session identifier. This
package rejects an empty `SessionID` by default; callers must provide a fresh,
non-secret, parties-agree-on sid for every session. `AllowEmptySessionID`
preserves draft-21 compatibility for tests or deliberate compatibility profiles,
but empty sids weaken replay and transcript separation properties. Default
empty-sid failures wrap both `ErrInvalidInput` and `ErrEmptySessionID`.

Any outer application negotiation of PAKE version, ciphersuite, protocol mode,
or whether CPace is used needs downgrade protection outside this package. The
package authenticates only the inputs it is given and has no negotiation API.

Each party supplies role-local identities: the initiator uses `SelfID=initiator, PeerID=responder`, and the responder uses `SelfID=responder, PeerID=initiator`. If one side swaps those values, the CI values differ and confirmation fails. Role labels such as `"client"` and `"server"` are not enough as global identities for all users or deployments; callers should bind stable party identities.

Scalar randomness always comes from Go's `crypto/rand.Reader`; callers cannot inject a custom random reader through the public API. X25519 scalar sampling reads exactly 32 random bytes, and the scalar multiplication ladder applies X25519 clamping before use. There is no scalar rejection loop in normal operation. Random read failure wraps `ErrRandomness`.

## Memory Handling

All mutable public inputs and received message fields are copied. The
implementation clears selected owned byte-slice temporaries, consumed scalar
state, derived generator elements, consumed responder state, and session key
material on a best-effort basis. `Session.Close` clears the session-owned ISK
and makes future `Export` calls fail with `ErrSessionClosed`. The Go runtime
does not guarantee secure zeroization, pinning, or avoidance of copies made by
the compiler or garbage collector. This package does not claim resistance to a
local memory disclosure adversary.

## Key Access

Raw `K`, scalar values, and ISK are not exposed through the public API. Exported
application material is derived from the confirmed ISK using HKDF-SHA512 and is
deterministic for a given label and context; it is not fresh randomness or a
randomness pool. A session is returned only after key confirmation succeeds.
`Respond` success alone does not authenticate the peer. `Session.PeerID` returns the caller-configured peer identity bound into CI, which the confirmed exchange proves both sides agreed on; it is copied from `Input`, not parsed from peer-controlled wire data. `Session.PeerAssociatedData` returns the peer associated data exactly as bound into the confirmed transcript: confirmation proves both sides saw the same transmitted `ADa`/`ADb` values, not that those values match any local expectation, so callers that bind outer commitments into associated data must compare `PeerAssociatedData` against the value they expected the peer to bind.

## Framing

The CPace draft leaves wire encoding to applications. This implementation uses a
package-owned binary framing with explicit version, suite, and role bytes plus
draft LEB128 length-value fields. Decoders reject trailing data, wrong
version/suite/role, malformed or non-canonical LEB128, oversized fields, invalid
point lengths, and invalid tag lengths.

Size limits for valid package-owned message shapes are per-field: passwords and party IDs are capped at 4 KiB, context and session IDs at 1 KiB, and local associated data at 64 KiB. Public-share and confirmation-tag fields are decoded with exact 32-byte and 64-byte limits. Malformed framed inputs also hit a 128 KiB aggregate decoder backstop before field parsing proceeds; this is an invalid-message throttle, not a replacement for the per-field valid-message caps. Local associated data is intended to bind outer protocol context; large external artifacts should normally be represented by a digest, Merkle root, exporter, or other fixed-size commitment.

Confirmation tags intentionally remain draft-compatible. This package does not
add extra role-label inputs to the draft-21 confirmation MACs.

## Error Surface

Peer-share rejections wrap `ErrAbort`, and `ErrPeerShareIdentity` refines X25519 low-order public shares that produce the all-zero shared-secret output. Errors from `Respond` and `Initiator.Finish` retain `invalid initiator share` / `invalid responder share` role context. Malformed wire lengths are rejected by framing as `ErrMessage` and never surface as peer-share sentinels; the internal wrong-length branch of share validation is defensive, `ErrAbort`-wrapped, and unreachable from the wire. `ErrPeerShareEncoding` remains exported for API continuity but is not normally produced by the X25519 public-share path, where every exact-length 32-byte string is passed to the X25519 ladder.

The finer rejection granularity is local observability for attacker-controlled wire bytes and must not be reflected to the remote peer before confirmation. The responder prevalidates message A with a fixed scalar before generator derivation or responder randomness, and both roles reject any all-zero X25519 output before deriving ISK.

Internally `scalarMultVFY` returns nil with a typed error on failure instead of draft-21's function-level neutral-element return convention. The divergence is intentional and internal-only: protocol abort behavior is unchanged and the draft's invalid-share vectors, including the neutral-element case, are still rejected. Detailed peer-share errors are for local logs and metrics; integrations must not reflect them to the remote peer before confirmation (see `docs/integration-guidance.md`).

## Dependencies

- `filippo.io/edwards25519 v1.2.0`

Dependency evidence freshness is indexed in `docs/evidence-baseline.md`. The lane-specific dependency, vulnerability, and SAST/gosec summary lives in `docs/dependency-review.md`. Refresh those through the baseline module before any stronger release claim.

## Fuzzing

Fuzz evidence freshness is indexed in `docs/evidence-baseline.md`. The lane-specific long-fuzz summary, target count, raw-log links, and historical prerelease soak notes live in `docs/fuzz-evidence.md`. Refresh those through the baseline module before any stronger release claim.

## Release Bar

Do not mark a release production-ready until:

- official draft-21 X25519/SHA-512 vectors pass
- `go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...` pass
- parser and protocol fuzz targets have completed a meaningful run
- every target in the fuzz-target registry (`.github/fuzz-targets.json`, with target function, package, and OSS-Fuzz binary name) has run for more than five minutes on release hardware or the manual long-fuzz workflow after the `go test ./...` drift check has passed
- `govulncheck -test ./...`, advisory `gosec`, and `staticcheck ./...` pass
- this assessment and `docs/spec-matrix.md` are reviewed
- no critical or high independent review findings remain

If draft-21 is superseded, freeze this package as a draft-21 implementation and
plan a separate compatibility update.
