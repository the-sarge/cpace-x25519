# Security Assessment

Status: self-assessment for an auditable draft implementation. Reviewed
against commit `4a8f629e59f0cc5c8f9351abacfa511fe6e4f441` on 2026-05-06;
see `docs/security-spec-audit.md`.

## Cryptographic Scope

Only `CPACE-RISTR255-SHA512` from `draft-irtf-cfrg-cpace-21` is implemented.
The public API exposes initiator-responder mode only and requires explicit key
confirmation before returning a `Session`.

## Secret-Dependent Behavior

The implementation delegates Ristretto255 group operations and scalar field
operations to `github.com/gtank/ristretto255 v0.2.0`, which documents constant
time operation except for explicitly variable-time APIs that this module does
not call.

Password handling follows the draft generator string padding rule. For short
passwords the first SHA-512 input block length is independent of password
length, but Go slice allocation and caller-side password handling are not
constant time.

The draft recommends, but does not require, a unique session identifier. This
package rejects an empty `SessionID` by default; callers must provide a fresh,
non-secret, parties-agree-on sid for every session. `AllowEmptySessionID`
preserves draft-21 compatibility for tests or deliberate compatibility profiles,
but empty sids weaken replay and transcript separation properties. Default
empty-sid failures wrap both `ErrInvalidInput` and `ErrEmptySessionID`.

Any outer application negotiation of PAKE version, ciphersuite, protocol mode,
or whether CPace is used needs downgrade protection outside this package. The
package authenticates only the inputs it is given and has no negotiation API.

Both parties must use a consistent role-ID orientation: `InitiatorID` names the
party running `Start`, and `ResponderID` names the party running `Respond`. If
each side puts itself first, the CI values differ and confirmation fails. Role
labels such as `"client"` and `"server"` are not enough as global identities for
all users or deployments; callers should bind stable party identities.

Scalar randomness always comes from Go's `crypto/rand.Reader`; callers cannot
inject a custom random reader through the public API. Scalar sampling masks bits
above group size 252, parses the result as a canonical scalar, and rejects zero.
The mask makes the canonical parse error path defensive; it should be
unreachable unless the sampling code changes. The zero check creates a
secret-dependent loop only for the all-zero masked scalar case. That event has
negligible probability with the system random reader. Sampling failure wraps
`ErrRandomness`. The package keeps this draft-21 Ristretto255 recommendation
for profile compatibility. Using the ristretto255 library's `SetUniformBytes`
plus zero rejection/retry would be an allowed draft alternative, but it consumes
64 random bytes and reduces modulo the scalar order, changing deterministic
behavior and defining a different package profile.

## Memory Handling

All mutable public inputs and received message fields are copied. The
implementation clears selected owned byte-slice temporaries, consumed scalar
state, derived generator elements, consumed responder state, and session key
material on a best-effort basis. `Session.Close` clears the session-owned ISK
and makes future `Export` calls fail with `ErrSessionClosed`. The Go runtime
does not guarantee secure zeroization, pinning, or avoidance of copies made by
the compiler or garbage collector. This package does not claim resistance to a
local memory disclosure adversary.

## Key Access

Raw `K`, scalar values, and ISK are not exposed through the public API. Exported
application material is derived from the confirmed ISK using HKDF-SHA512 and is
deterministic for a given label and context; it is not fresh randomness or a
randomness pool. A session is returned only after key confirmation succeeds.
`Respond` success alone does not authenticate the peer. `Session.PeerID` and
`Session.PeerAssociatedData` return metadata that each side configured locally
and that the confirmed exchange proves both sides agreed on. `PeerID` is copied
from `Config`, not parsed from peer-controlled wire data.

## Framing

The CPace draft leaves wire encoding to applications. This implementation uses a
package-owned binary framing with explicit version, suite, and role bytes plus
draft LEB128 length-value fields. Decoders reject trailing data, wrong
version/suite/role, malformed or non-canonical LEB128, oversized fields, invalid
point lengths, and invalid tag lengths.

Size limits are per-field, not aggregate message limits: passwords and party
IDs are capped at 4 KiB, context and session IDs at 1 KiB, and associated data
at 64 KiB. Public-share and confirmation-tag fields are decoded with exact
32-byte and 64-byte limits. Associated data is intended to bind outer protocol
context; large external artifacts should normally be represented by a digest,
Merkle root, exporter, or other fixed-size commitment.

Confirmation tags intentionally remain draft-compatible. This package does not
add extra role-label inputs to the draft-21 confirmation MACs.

## Dependencies

- `github.com/gtank/ristretto255 v0.2.0`
- `filippo.io/edwards25519 v1.2.0` as an indirect dependency

Dependency review was refreshed on 2026-05-06 at commit
`06f21c51645f54e2b7bde7c5b538479463be5d0e`; see
`docs/dependency-review.md`. `govulncheck -test -show verbose ./...` found no
vulnerabilities, and `gosec v2.26.1` reported zero issues after the LEB128
parser cleanup in that commit. Repeat the review against the exact release tag
if any dependency, toolchain, or parser/security-relevant code changes before
release.

## Fuzzing

Fuzz target evidence is recorded in `docs/fuzz-evidence.md`. The current
release-readiness run covers all 14 targets registered in
`.github/fuzz-targets.json` at commit
`06f21c51645f54e2b7bde7c5b538479463be5d0e`, with a local smoke run and long
ARM and Intel runs.

## Release Bar

Do not mark a release production-ready until:

- official draft-21 Ristretto255/SHA-512 vectors pass
- `go test ./...` and `go test -race ./...` pass
- parser and protocol fuzz targets have completed a meaningful run
- every target in `.github/fuzz-targets.json` has run for more than five
  minutes on release hardware or the manual long-fuzz workflow
- `govulncheck -test ./...`, advisory `gosec`, and `staticcheck ./...` pass
- this assessment and `docs/spec-matrix.md` are reviewed
- no critical or high independent review findings remain

If draft-21 is superseded, freeze this package as a draft-21 implementation and
plan a separate compatibility update.
