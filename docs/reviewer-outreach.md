## Short Note

Hello,

I am looking for external review of a Go CPace draft implementation:

`https://github.com/the-sarge/cpace`

The package implements only `CPACE-RISTR255-SHA512` from
`draft-irtf-cfrg-cpace-21`, in initiator-responder mode with mandatory explicit
key confirmation. It is explicitly marked as an auditable draft implementation,
not production-ready cryptographic software.

The review handoff is here:

`https://github.com/the-sarge/cpace/blob/main/docs/external-review-handoff.md`

The threat model is here:

`https://github.com/the-sarge/cpace/blob/main/docs/threat-model.md`

The most useful review focus would be:

- package-owned context-info construction and role-local identity input;
- binary wire framing and field-size limits;
- empty-session-ID policy and integration guidance;
- scalar sampling, invalid-point handling, confirmation, exporter, and session
  lifecycle claims;
- whether the CI, dependency, fuzz, and signed-release evidence is sufficient
  for an auditable prerelease while independent cryptographic review remains a
  blocker.

The public tracking issues for those review areas are:

- `https://github.com/the-sarge/cpace/issues/29`
- `https://github.com/the-sarge/cpace/issues/30`
- `https://github.com/the-sarge/cpace/issues/31`

The latest public prerelease remains `v0.1.2`, an SSH-signed annotated tag and
historical prerelease context. The current exact-candidate evidence bundle is
indexed in `docs/evidence-baseline.md` and captured under Go 1.26.4 at package
code commit `f7efa6a963a954952b1ecad3f46530f13799fe89`:

`https://github.com/the-sarge/cpace/tree/main/docs/evidence/f7efa6a-20260619`

This is still unaudited prerelease evidence, not a production-readiness claim.

Please report private vulnerabilities through the channels in `SECURITY.md`.
Public review notes that are not sensitive can be opened as GitHub issues.

Thank you.
