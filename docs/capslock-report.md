# Capslock Report

Date: 2026-06-11

Target module: `github.com/the-sarge/cpace`

Package-code baseline: `933ece246e6170b11e838395bf36f852cba0cd02`

Status: external-review evidence. Capslock is experimental static capability
analysis; this report is review signal, not a release gate.

This report refreshes the Capslock evidence after the go1.26.4 toolchain
security release (2026-06-02) and the security-relevant package-code changes
merged in PR #73. The refresh was run from a clean worktree at the
package-code baseline. The capability summary is **identical** to the
2026-05-08 report — same classes, same counts — confirming no
capability-surface change from either trigger.

## Tool

```sh
go run github.com/google/capslock/cmd/capslock@v0.3.2 -version
```

Result:

```text
capslock version v0.3.2
compiled with Go version go1.26.4
includes Go tools version v0.43.0
```

## Command

```sh
go run github.com/google/capslock/cmd/capslock@v0.3.2 -packages ./...
```

## Summary

```text

Verbose output preserved the same capability classes and example call paths:

```text
ARBITRARY_EXECUTION: 6 references (6 direct, 0 transitive)
Example callpath:
  github.com/the-sarge/cpace.Respond
  api.go:164:26:github.com/the-sarge/cpace.respondWithRandom

UNANALYZED: 5 references (5 direct, 0 transitive)
Example callpath:

  api.go:142:24:github.com/the-sarge/cpace.sampleScalar
  crypto.go:59:27:io.ReadFull
```

(Line numbers shifted with the PR #73 changes; the call paths and capability
classes are unchanged.)

The package does not directly expose filesystem, network, subprocess, dynamic
loading, environment mutation, or other broad operating-system capabilities in
the default Capslock summary.

## Finding Triage

| Capability | Count | Paths | Triage |
| --- | ---: | --- | --- |
| `ARBITRARY_EXECUTION` | 6 | `Respond`, `confirmationTag`, `respondWithRandom`, `Initiator.Finish`, `Responder.Finish`, `Session.Export` through `crypto/hmac.New` or `crypto/hkdf.Key` into Go's `crypto/fips140.isBypassed` path. | Tool classification from Go standard-library FIPS enforcement internals, not an application subprocess or dynamic-code execution path in this module. Keep under review when Go toolchains change. |
| `UNANALYZED` | 5 | `Start`, `Respond`, `startWithRandom`, `respondWithRandom`, and `sampleScalar` through `io.ReadFull`. | Expected for scalar-randomness reads. Public `Start` and `Respond` use `crypto/rand.Reader`; tests and fuzzing use package-internal deterministic readers. |

## Residual Risk

Repeat this report when dependencies, Go toolchain, randomness handling,
HKDF/HMAC usage, or package imports change. Treat new filesystem, network,
process, plugin, environment, or unsafe capability classes as external-review
findings before a release-readiness claim.
